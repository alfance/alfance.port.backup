            //problem
            "The biggest pain that every cyclist has experienced, especially the urban cyclist, is various road conditions and incidents that lead to unexpected detours. Looking for an applicable route can be time consuming, while bypassing the original road can be dangerous. Currently there have been apps that help cyclists navigate through the road, but they do not offer alternate route options. most importantly, cyclists needed to be constantly updated while they are biking.",
            //solution

After you entered your destination, the app calculates the best route for you and grabs realtime data of the road conditions. You can then choose between the shortest route and the recommended route",

            "Cycnav bike light can easily be attached and detached from any bike, giving greater accessibility to consumers. Cyclists do not have to purchase a new bike or replace sections of their bike. They can easily place the Cycnav physical interface into their bag or bring it inside when it is not in use.",
