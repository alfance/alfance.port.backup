            "As the digital invasion penetrates into people’s daily life, environmental health has become a critical concern for today’s shrinking living space and heavy urbanization (Dunnett, 2004). ",

            "The Modular Vertical Garden is a digital and ‘smart’ system that I designed to ease the pain points of maintaining a vertical garden. The modularity allows users to have a garden as big or as small as he/she likes, flexible to the constraints of physical space and personal preference. ",
            //problem
            "Vertical gardens (green wall) are great resource for home use. However, the cost of design, construction and maintenance are factors that hinder the development of vertical garden into different architectural types and expanding into multiple user segments. Because of this, home gardening is still at a lagging stage within the rapid development of digital media.",
            //solution
            "The modular garden allows users to have a garden as big or as small as he/she likes, flexible to the constraints of physical space and personal preference. It talks to the web, allowing the user to observe and control the vegetation right off of their computer or smartphone device. This project benefits apartment/condo dwellers and people who have limited physical space time and efforts. ",

            "For ever garden, there is a central unit where power source and internet modules are stored. When additinal unit connects to the central unit, Data is transfered. Whenever the customer introduced a new plant or member to the “family”, the transmitter will send the basic information to the app, thus updated in the interface. ",

            "The digital interface is simple and minimal. it has two main pages: one that displays the garden's overall condition; and another one display each plant individual status.",
